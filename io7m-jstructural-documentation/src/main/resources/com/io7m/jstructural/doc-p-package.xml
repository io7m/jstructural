      <s:subsection-title>Overview</s:subsection-title>
      <s:paragraph>
        The <s:term s:type="package">structural</s:term>
        package implements a set of primitives for producing technical
        documentation. The package provides
        <s:link-external s:target="http://relaxng.org/">RELAX-NG</s:link-external>
        and <s:link-external s:target="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XSD</s:link-external>
        schemas describing the format of <s:term s:type="package">structural</s:term>
        documents and a set of
        <s:link-external s:target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</s:link-external>
        1.0 and 2.0 stylesheets for producing XHTML output.
      </s:paragraph>
      <s:paragraph>
        In contrast to other systems such as
        <s:link-external s:target="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook</s:link-external>,
        the <s:term s:type="package">structural</s:term>
        language only defines elements concerning the structure of the document
        and not the semantics of the elements. The intention is that higher
        level languages will produce <s:term s:type="package">structural</s:term>
        documents as output and then use the provided stylesheets to get various
        services such as table of contents generation, chapter numbering,
        footnotes, et cetera, without having to re-implement all of those
        features for each new language.
      </s:paragraph>
    </s:subsection>
    <s:subsection>
      <s:subsection-title>Portability</s:subsection-title>
      <s:paragraph>
        The canonical format for the <s:term s:type="package">structural</s:term>
        schema is RELAX-NG, but an XSD schema (generated from the RELAX-NG
        schema is also provided, for validation using tools that do not support
        RELAX-NG).
      </s:paragraph>
      <s:paragraph>
        The provided XSLT stylesheets are written in pure XSLT 1.0, with the
        exception of one extension per XSLT implementation for the purposes of
        producing multiple output documents from XML source
        <s:footnote>XSLT 1.0 does not support producing multiple documents from
          one XML source file, requiring the use of implementation-specific
          extensions. This restriction is lifted in XSLT 2.0, which has a
          standard element for producing multiple output documents.</s:footnote>.
        A pure XSLT 2.0 stylesheet is also provided, which should be
        completely implementation independent
        <s:footnote>The package produces both stylesheets from a common source
          at "compile" time.</s:footnote>.
      </s:paragraph>
    </s:subsection>
    <s:subsection>
      <s:subsection-title>Simplicity</s:subsection-title>
      <s:paragraph>
        As the <s:term s:type="package">structural</s:term>
        language focuses only on structural elements, it is far simpler than any
        of the other XML documentation formats. As an example,
        <s:link-external s:target="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook</s:link-external>,
        which mixes structural and semantic elements, defines nearly 400
        elements as opposed to the 30 or so defined by the
        <s:term s:type="package">structural</s:term> language.
      </s:paragraph>
      <s:paragraph>
        Given the small number of elements and the relatively strict schema, the
        number of possible permutations of elements is low and, as a result, the
        XSLT stylesheets are simple and the XHTML output is easily predictable
        <s:footnote>There are various combinations of DocBook elements that are
          valid according to the schema but cannot realistically be used due to
          the resulting XHTML output.</s:footnote>.
      </s:paragraph>

    <s:section-title>Installation</s:section-title>
    <s:subsection>
      <s:subsection-title>Installation Requirements</s:subsection-title>
      <s:paragraph>
        The package has no specific requirements for installation beyond
        minimal POSIX <s:term s:type="command">sh</s:term>,
        <s:term s:type="command">sed</s:term>, and
        <s:term s:type="command">make</s:term> implementations used to
        process source files to produce the XSLT stylesheets.
      </s:paragraph>
      <s:paragraph>
        Currently, the package requires
        <s:link-external s:target="http://xmlsoft.org/">xmllint</s:link-external>
        and
        <s:link-external s:target="http://xmlsoft.org/">xsltproc</s:link-external>
        to build the optional documentation. The documentation can obviously be
        built by hand using any XSLT 1.0/2.0 compliant processor; it is just
        that there is currently no explicit support for this in the
        <s:term s:type="file">Makefile</s:term>.
      </s:paragraph>
    </s:subsection>
    <s:subsection>
      <s:subsection-title>Installation</s:subsection-title>
      <s:paragraph>
        To produce the stylesheets, compile the package with the
        <s:term s:type="command">make</s:term> command:
        <s:verbatim s:type="terminal">make</s:verbatim>
      </s:paragraph>
      <s:paragraph>
        Compilation will produce two directories,
        <s:term s:type="file">dist-10</s:term>
        and <s:term s:type="file">dist-20</s:term>.
      </s:paragraph>
      <s:paragraph>
        Optionally, the following command compiles the documentation:
        <s:verbatim s:type="terminal"><![CDATA[make documentation]]></s:verbatim>
      </s:paragraph>
    </s:subsection>
    <s:subsection>
      <s:subsection-title>Post Installation</s:subsection-title>
      <s:paragraph>
        The <s:term s:type="package">structural</s:term> package is written with
        the expectation that the files produced by compilation will be
        copied directly into projects wishing to use it. If the projects in
        question use XSLT 1.0, files from the <s:term s:type="file">dist-10</s:term>
        directory should be used. If the projects in question use XSLT 2.0,
        files from the <s:term s:type="file">dist-20</s:term> directory should
        be used.
      </s:paragraph>
      <s:paragraph>
        The following CSS files should be included in XML projects directly (or
        more accurately, along with the XHTML output produced by the XML
        project):
        <s:list-unordered>
          <s:list-item>
            <s:term s:type="file">structural-1_0_0-layout.css</s:term>
          </s:list-item>
          <s:list-item>
            <s:term s:type="file">structural-1_0_0-colour.css</s:term>
          </s:list-item>
        </s:list-unordered>
      </s:paragraph>
      <s:paragraph>
        If the project in question uses RELAX-NG for validation, the file
        <s:term s:type="file">structural-1_0_0.rng</s:term> should be included.
        Otherwise, the files <s:term s:type="file">structural-1_0_0.xsd</s:term> and
        <s:term s:type="file">xml.xsd</s:term> should be included.
      </s:paragraph>
      <s:paragraph>
        Compilation produces two top-level stylesheets per XSLT version. The
        stylesheet(s)
        <s:term s:type="file">structural-1_0_0-standalone-x{10,20}.xsl</s:term>
        produce multi-page XHTML documents as output. The stylesheet(s)
        <s:term s:type="file">structural-1_0_0-single-x{10,20}.xsl</s:term>
        produce single-page XHTML documents as output. The single-page
        stylesheets are essentially considered supplemental to the
        multi-page stylesheets and this documentation is written in terms
        of the multi-page stylesheets. Where relevant, the differences
        between the two are documented.

      The XSLT 1.0 stylesheets have been tested and are known to work with the
      following XSLT processors:

        <s:list-item>
          <s:link-external s:target="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">xalan-java</s:link-external>

        <s:list-item>
          <s:link-external s:target="http://xmlsoft.org">xsltproc</s:link-external>
          version 1.1.26 and above.

    </s:paragraph>
    <s:paragraph>
      The XSLT 2.0 stylesheets have been tested and are known to work with the
      following XSLT processors:

        <s:list-item>
          <s:link-external s:target="http://saxon.sourceforge.net">saxon</s:link-external>

        The "Home Edition" versions of
        <s:link-external s:target="http://saxon.sourceforge.net">Saxon</s:link-external>
        do not support the extensions required to create multiple output
        documents with XSLT 1.0 stylesheets. It is necessary to either use the
        XSLT 2.0 stylesheets with these versions of Saxon, or use a commercially
        supported version of Saxon.
